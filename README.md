## Responsive Design Features

This project has been optimized for responsiveness across multiple devices:

- **Mobile-first approach**: All components are designed to work on small screens first, then enhanced for larger viewports
- **Responsive Typography**: Text scales appropriately based on screen size
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Components change layout and positioning based on available space
- **Performance Optimized**: Images and animations are conditionally loaded/displayed for better performance
- **Touch-friendly**: Interactive elements are properly sized for touch devices

## Component Structure

The website uses a modular component structure for maintainability:

- `components/ui/`: Reusable UI components
  - `Container.astro`: Responsive container with consistent padding
  - `ResponsiveImage.astro`: Optimized image component with proper loading strategies
  - `Navbar.astro`: Responsive navigation with mobile menu
  - `InfoBox.astro`: Information display with responsive positioning
  - `CursorFollow.astro`: Custom cursor for desktop devices
  - `SquareBackground.astro`: Responsive grid background with device-specific optimizations
  - `NoiseBackground.astro`: Subtle texture overlay

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: Fast, modern static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **GSAP**: Animation library for smooth, performant animations
- **Lenis**: Smooth scrolling library

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

The site uses the following responsive breakpoints:

- **Mobile**: < 640px (sm)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 768px (md)
- **Desktop**: 768px - 1024px (lg)
- **Large Desktop**: > 1024px (xl+)

## Performance Considerations

- Large grid backgrounds are conditionally rendered based on device
- Animations are simplified on mobile devices
- Images use appropriate loading strategies (lazy loading for below-fold content)
- CSS animations are preferred over JavaScript when possible
